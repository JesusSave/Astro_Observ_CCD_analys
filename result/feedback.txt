Dear Chen,

You managed to obtain the lightcuvers and you have passed the observing
course - congratulations.

I found my reduced images have negative background, could this be caused
by dark frame subtraction?

If the reduction is done properly the backgroud is positive.
I have checked the 22 Aug 2019 night.
The average bias is 325.6
The average dark is 3.7 - this is after bias subtraction
    and has to be scaled by the exposure time (*25/300) while subtracting
    from the science images.
An example reduced image background is 138.0 (ab_and-0020V1.fits)


I have few additional comments.

- The scripts you have used are not perfect for our data - we were doing
a series of dark frames for the whole nights, while the scripts assume
to have the dark exposures mixed with the science frames.

- The tradition in stellar optical photometry is to present the light curves
in magnitudes, not in normalized flux units. Please take a look at the
example light curve from 22 Aug 2019 in V (attached).

Best regards,
Wojtek

QC: 向守平《天体物理概论》Eq.2.2 
m2-m1 = -2.5 lg (E2/E1)
Then I need to have a reference star and know its magnetitude m1.
